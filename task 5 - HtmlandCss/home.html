                    Education is the best legacy, "Train up a child in way
                    he should grow and when he is old he will not depart 
                    from it" this sentence is a bible verse and it holds
                    so must truth, the future generation is shaped based 
                    on the impactation of the current generation(parents,

                    Here at LGCS our task is to not only impact knowledge but also
                    morals and leadership and nation building skills. We engage in 
                    counselling sessions for our students and pupils, and we ensure
                     that every staff is morally and educationally sound, because you
                     can only give what you have on the inside.
