# 1. Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's benefits in software development.

Scrum is an agile framework for addressing complex adaptive problems while producing high-value products in a productive and creative manner.
Scrum is a lightweight framework that assists individuals, teams, and organizations in creating value by providing adaptive solutions to complex problems.

Scrum necessitates the presence of a Scrum Master in order to foster an environment in which:
1. A Product Owner adds work to a Product Backlog for a complex problem.
2. During a Sprint, the Scrum Team converts a selection of work into a value increment.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders review the results and make adjustments for the following Sprint.
4. Repeat

Benefits of Scrum methodology
1. __Quality products__ - The Scrum process incorporates feedback and continuous improvement during the Sprint retrospective. 
2. __Teamwork__ - Scrum fosters cohesive software development teams that communicate effectively, meet deadlines, and collaborate to solve problems. Members trust and respect one another and recognize the value of their time. This could imply limiting the daily Scrum to a specific timeframe. 
3. __Flexibility__ -Scrum teams must adapt their tools and processes to changing circumstances as they occur. Product definitions can change as development progresses, and effective teams can implement those changes in a few iterations.
4. __Reduced risk__ - Scrum focuses on a predictable, sustainable delivery pace and consistent feedback that gives teams a chance to mitigate risk early and often. Short sprints let teams fail fast if an idea doesn't work, keeping the risk of failure manageable.
5. __Reduced time to market__ - Scrum aims to deliver products and features in predictable increments through the use of well-defined sprints. It is not necessary to complete the entire product before releasing features. 
6. __Increased ROI__ - The combined benefits of Scrum result in a higher ROI. Constant feedback results in fewer costly mistakes later in the process as well as a better product with fewer defects. Reduced time to market and incremental releases increase revenue more quickly.


# 2. From the Agile Manifesto, complete the following: 

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan
